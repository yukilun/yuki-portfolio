# Yuki Lun's Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio website showcased all my web development or ux / ui design projects that I have worked on over the last two years at Douglas College and at home. Throughout my web development journey, I acquired lots of front-end and back-end skills.  I would like to give credit to every instructor that I met at Douglas College, as well as to all the great tutors on YouTube. 

Building this portfolio website has also taught me a lot. First of all, I learned how to use Nuxt.js, a server-side rendering framework built on Vue. Besides that, I also learned how to create simple animations, transitions, and parallax effects on scroll using the IntersectionObserver API. I really enjoyed creating this website a lot, including drawing bubbles, adding custom cursors, and building the custom bottom navigation menu.
