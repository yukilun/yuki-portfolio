## Overview
This portfolio website showcases all the web development or ux / ui design projects that I have done so far. Throughout my two years of learning at Douglas College and at home, I have acquired a lot of front-end and back-end skills.  I would like to give credit to every instructor that I met at Douglas College, as well as to all the great tutors on YouTube. 

Building this portfolio website has also taught me a lot. First of all, I learned how to use Nuxt.js, a server-side rendering framework built on Vue. Besides that, I also learned how to create simple animations, transitions, and parallax effects on scroll using the IntersectionObserver API. I really enjoyed creating this website a lot, like drawing bubbles, adding custom cursors, and building the custom bottom navigation menu.
